## Using the library

In order to use this library with vl you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org.

Open VL, go to

```
Quad menu > Manage Nugets > Commandline   
```

 and then type :

```
nuget install VL.2D.DollarQ -pre
```

For more about installing nugets, [read here](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/libraries/referencing.html).

Once the VL.2D.DollarQ nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document, you'll see the DollarQ category under the 2D category in the node browser.

Open the help browser with <kbd>F1</kbd> and look for "dollar" to find the help patches.
